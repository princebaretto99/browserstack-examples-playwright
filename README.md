# BrowserStack Examples Playwright Framework <a href="https://playwright.dev/"><img src="https://playwright.dev/img/playwright-logo.svg" alt="Playwright" height="30" />

## Introduction

Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.

This BrowserStack Example repository demonstrates a test framework written in Playwright Framework with parallel testing capabilities. The Playwright test scripts are written for the open source [BrowserStack Demo web application](https://bstackdemo.com) ([Github](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-demo-app)). This BrowserStack Demo App is an e-commerce web application which showcases multiple real-world user scenarios. The app is bundled with offers data, orders data and products data that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

The Playwright tests are run on different platforms like on-prem and BrowserStack using various run configurations and test capabilities.

## About the tests in this repository

  This repository contains the following Selenium tests:

  | Module   | Test name                          | Description |
  | ---   | ---                                   | --- |
  | e2e      | E2E Test                | This test scenario verifies successful product purchase lifecycle end-to-end. It demonstrates the [Page Object Model design pattern](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/page-object-model-in-selenium) and is also the default test executed in all the single test run profiles. |
  | login    | Check if Signin opens on clicking on favourites nav item          | This test verifies the login workflow with different types of valid login users. |
  | login    | Check Login with locked_user               | This test verifies the login workflow error for a locked user. |
  | offers   | Set GPS location to Mumbai and check offers     | This test mocks the GPS location for Mumbai and verifies that the product offers applicable for the Mumbai location are shown.   |
  | product  | Apply Apple And Samsung Filter          | This test verifies that the Apple products are only shown if the Apple vendor filter option is applied. |
  | product  | Apply 'Lowest to Highest' Order By Filter   | This test verifies that the product prices are in ascending order when the product sort "Lowest to Highest" is applied. |
  | user     | Check Login with image_not_loading_user | This test verifies that the product images load for user: "image_not_loading_user" on the e-commerce application. Since the images do not load, the test case assertion fails.|
  | user     | Check Order in existing_orders_user |  This test verifies that existing orders are shown for user: "existing_orders_user"  |

## Test infrastructure environments 

- [On-premise/self-hosted](#on-premise-self-hosted)
- [BrowserStack](#browserstack)


# On Premise / Self Hosted

This infrastructure points to running the tests on your own machine using a browser (e.g. Chrome) using the browser's driver executables (e.g. ChromeDriver for Chrome). #{ Selenium enables this functionality using WebDriver for many popular browsers.}


## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on your own machine

- How to run the test?

  To run a specific test scenario, use the following command with the additional 'test-name' argument:
  
  ```sh
  npx playwright test <spec-file> --headed --config=resources/conf/playwright.config.js --project <project-name>
  ```

  where,  the argument `<spec-file>` can be any spec files from the repository.
  
  E.g. "e2e.spec.js", "login.spec.js", "product.spec.js" or any of the other tests, as outlined in [About the tests in this repository](#About-the-tests-in-this-repository) section.

  Also, the argument `<project-name>` can be any of the project names from the `playwright.conf.js` file.

  Or, you can directly run the pre-confifured setup by running the below command:
  ```sh
  npm run onPrem-endToEnd
  ```

- Output

  This run profile executes a specific test scenario on a single browser instance on your own machine.


### Run the entire test suite in parallel on your own machine

  To run the entire test suite on your own machine, use the following command:
  
  ```sh
  npx playwright test --headed --config=resources/conf/playwright.config.js --workers 2
  ```

  Or, you can directly run the pre-confifured setup by running the below command:

  ```sh
  npm run onPrem-parallel
  ```


- Output

  This run profile executes the entire test collection in parallel on single/multiple browsers based on the configuration file, on your own machine.

# BrowserStack

[BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) provides instant access to 2,000+ real mobile devices and browsers on a highly reliable cloud infrastructure that effortlessly scales as testing needs grow.

## Prerequisites

- Create a new [BrowserStack account](https://www.browserstack.com/users/sign_up) or use an existing one.
- Identify your BrowserStack username and access key from the [BrowserStack Automate Dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/) and export them as environment variables using the below commands.

    - For \*nix based and Mac machines:

  ```sh
  export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username> &&
  export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```

    - For Windows:

  ```shell
  set BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username>
  set BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```
  
  Alternatively, you can also hardcode username and access_key objects in the [fixtures.js](./fixtures.js) file.

Note:
- We have configured a list of test capabilities in the [playwright-bstack.config.js](resources/conf/playwright-bstack.config.js) file. You can certainly update them based on your device / browser test requirements. 
- The exact test capability values can be easily identified using the [Browserstack Capability Generator](https://browserstack.com/automate/capabilities) and the allowed Browsers and OS are mentioned [here](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/playwright/browsers-and-os)


## Running Your Tests

  ```

  where,  the argument `<spec-file>` can be any spec files from the repository.
  
  E.g. "e2e.spec.js", "login.spec.js", "product.spec.js" or any of the other tests, as outlined in [About the tests in this repository](#About-the-tests-in-this-repository) section.

  Also, the argument `<project-name>` can be any of the project names from the `playwright-bstack.conf.js` file.

  Or, you can directly run the pre-confifured setup by running the below command:

  ```sh
  npm run bstack-single
  ```

- Output

  This run profile executes a single test on a single browser on BrowserStack. Please refer to your [BrowserStack dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/) for test results.


### Run the entire test suite in parallel on a single BrowserStack browser

In this section, we will run the tests in parallel on a single browser on Browserstack. Refer to `playwright-bstack.conf.js` file to change test capabilities for this configuration.

- How to run the test?

  To run the entire test suite in parallel on a single BrowserStack browser, use the following command:
